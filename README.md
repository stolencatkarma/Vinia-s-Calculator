## Example Calculations

**Vinia's Token Example**:

- 5 cards needed per turn-in
- 10 Orbs of Regret per turn-in
- Orbs of Regret cost 1.3 chaos each directly (current market price)
- **Result**: Cards give you ~1.43 chaos per Regret vs 1.3 chaos direct = **10% more expensive via cards**

**Seven Years Bad Luck Example**:

- **Result**: Cards cost ~6,051.2 chaos per Mirror Shard vs 6,400 chaos direct = **5% SAVINGS via cards**

**The Enlightened Example**:
- 6 cards at 92 chaos each = 552 chaos total
- 6 cards = 1 level 3 Enlighten Support gem
- Level 4 Enlighten Support costs 4,494 chaos (21.2 Divine) directly
- **Result**: Cards cost ~552 chaos per Enlighten vs 4,494 chaos direct = **88% SAVINGS via cards!**

**Luminous Trove Example**:
- 7 cards at 2.3 Divine each = 3,412.4 chaos total
- 7 cards = 1 Divine Orb
- Divine Orbs cost 212 chaos each directly
